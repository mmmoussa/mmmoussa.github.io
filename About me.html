                I am a hard-working and motivated individual with excellent time management and communication skills. I dedicate 
                myself to self-improvement and am constantly looking for new and challenging problems. I enjoy software 
                development, and am frequently learning new languages or working on side projects. <br><br>Currently, I am 
                in my 1A term (first term) of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am in search of a 
                co-op position relating to software development (mobile, web, or other) for the period of January-April, 2015.
